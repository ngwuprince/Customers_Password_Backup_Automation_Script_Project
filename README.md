**Automatic Backup Script (backup.sh):**

As a Linux developer contracted by ABC International Inc.(arbitrary place holder name), I have tackled a critical bottleneck in our daily operations. We were faced with the arduous task of manually accessing encrypted password files on core servers and backing up any updates made within the last 24 hours. This process was prone to human error, compromised security, and was overly time-consuming.

**Project Overview:**

I present to you the backup.sh script, a solution designed to streamline and automate this backup process. With this script, you can ensure the timely and accurate backup of encrypted password files, enhancing both security and efficiency.

Features
- Automatically identifies encrypted password files that were modified in the last 24 hours.
- Creates backups of the identified files, preserving data integrity.
- Eliminates the need for manual intervention, reducing human error.
- Enhances security by consistently and reliably managing backups.
